-- Abstract

  A smart contract is a program that lives on the blockchain, intended
  to automatically execute on specific transactional events. With its
  widespread use in bitcoin technology, it is vulnerable to several
  attacks and security breaches which has led to loss of millions of
  dollars. Many techniques have been used to discover vulnerabilities
  and ensure system safety such as model checking, simulations, automatic
  provers and other state-based models. However, these techniques have
  given low security assurance and failed to produce reasonable results.
  In this project, we will use higher-order-logic(HOL) theorem prover to
  model the system as HOL predicates and prove functional properties to
  ensure functional correctness with strong security assurance.
